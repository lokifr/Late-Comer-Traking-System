# ⚠️ Project Status: Archived:
This project is no longer maintained. This project was created as a practical workflow implementation to strengthen my Python GUI and data handling skills. It is no longer actively maintained. A known issue with case-sensitive roll number matching *remains unresolved*, as I have moved on to learning and building new projects.(The project still works with my master file stored on my Google Drive.)

 # Note 
Here I've given an example excel file called “tata.xlsx” which contains the necessary student data…. the excel file u give MUST contain roll no, name, dept and  year columns.
- username:admin
- password:letmein
